#### What you will learn

AWS Lambda functions running Node.JS can make calls over the Internet to APIs and services using the ```https``` module included in Javascript.

For example, your function can define the following module:

```var https = require('https');```

You can make a POST call to a service such as:

https://cp6gckjt97.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/stateresource

Unlike an HTTPS GET, you cannot test a POST URL in your browser to see the web service in action.
A POST service expects a request message to be packaged and transmitted by your code.

You will need to break apart the web service URL into components as shown.


```
    var post_data = {"usstate": myData};

    var post_options = {
        host:  'cp6gckjt97.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com',
        port: '443',
        path: '/prod/stateresource',
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'Content-Length': Buffer.byteLength(JSON.stringify(post_data))
        }
    };
```

Once the web service call has been setup, you can execute it by sending in your post_data object:

```
    post_req.write(JSON.stringify(post_data));
    post_req.end();
```

This particular service returns a JSON object.  Your code will need to parse and process the response data from your web service.

Sample response:
```
{"Name":"New Jersey","population":9000000,"rank":11}
```
