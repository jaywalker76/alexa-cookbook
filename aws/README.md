### Intro <a id="intro"></a>
Alexa skill developers can take advantage of the various services available within Amazon Web Services.

AWS offers a range of developer and IT services, including: database, file storage, messaging, virtual servers, and IOT connected devices.

Your skill code can call AWS services by incorporating into your project the AWS SDK for Node.js.

```var AWS = require('aws-sdk');```

This Node module is automatically included and available to all AWS Lambda functions.

You can further configure the AWS connection via the Config:
```
var myConfig = new AWS.Config();
myConfig.update({region: 'us-east-1'});
```

See the [AWS SDK reference docs](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-node-js/).

### IAM Roles

Lambda functions execute in the context of a given IAM Role.  [IAM](https://aws.amazon.com/iam), or Identity and Access Management, manages various security controls within AWS.
An IAM Role is a collection of various permissions that a process can assume to perform its work.

Your AWS Lambda function code does not need a ```accessKeyId``` or ```secretAccessKey``` to be defined as would an application external to AWS.

You setup a default role when you created your very first lambda function.
This role is typically called **```lambda_basic_execution```**.

* Lambda functions that call out to other AWS services require additional permissions.  You can add permissions by attaching a Policy to your role.
